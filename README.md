CoolProp Python Examples

This repository contains Python examples demonstrating the use of CoolProp, a library for calculating thermophysical properties of fluids. The examples cover basic property calculations, using state objects, plotting thermodynamic diagrams, and generating phase diagrams.

Installation

Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required packages:

pip install CoolProp matplotlib numpy

Repository Contents
1. Basic Property Calculation

Calculate fundamental properties like density of a fluid at a given temperature and pressure.


2. Using AbstractState

Use the AbstractState object to calculate multiple properties of a fluid simultaneously, such as enthalpy, entropy, and density.

3. Thermodynamic Plots

Generate thermodynamic diagrams such as Temperature–Entropy (T–s), Pressure–Enthalpy (P–h) plots and more.

4. Phase Diagram Visualization

Create phase diagrams to visualize the state (solid, liquid, gas, or two-phase) of a fluid over a range of pressures and temperatures as an example of how one could use coolprop.
